Code Implements our model of PRL development (which is basically the Bayesian version of a Kalman filter) and simulates 100 trials of saccades. In this model, the positional uncertainties are updated after each trail. 

Details on math are provided in UpdatePriors.doc

run_simulation.m starts the simulation.
