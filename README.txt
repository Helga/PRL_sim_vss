Code Implements our model of PRL development, which is basically a Bayesian version of a Kalman filter, and simulates 100 trials of saccades. In this model, the positional uncertainties are updated after each trail. 

Details on math are provided in UpdatePriors.doc

run_simulation.m starts the simulation.
